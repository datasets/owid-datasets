# OWID Dataset Collection

The data format and organization of this repository isn't yet finalized, use with caution!

This is an ongoing collection of datasets with source information in CSV+datapackage format, exported automatically from the ourworldindata.org database. Most datasets included here are annual time series data for social and economic indicators by country.

The repository covers mainly smaller datasets which have been individually uploaded and annotated with source information by OWID authors. We also use some larger external data collections on the website like the World Development Indicators, which aren't currently included here.
